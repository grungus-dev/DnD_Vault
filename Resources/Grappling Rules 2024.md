# GRAPPLED [CONDITION] 
While you have the Grappled condition, you experience the following effects. 

**Speed 0.** Your Speed is O and can't increase. 
**Attacks Affected.** You have Disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the grappler. 
**Movable.** The grappler can drag or carry you when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 1 extra foot unless you are Tiny or two or more sizes smaller than it.

# GRAPPLING 
A creature can grapple another creature. Characters typically grapple by using an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is initiated, it follows these rules. See also "Unarmed Strike" and "Grappled." 

**Grappled Condition.** Successfully grappling a creature gives it the Grappled condition. 

**One Grapple per Hand.** A creature must have a hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. Whatever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one creature at a time with that part, and the grappler can't use that part to target another creature unless it ends the grapple. 

**Escaping a Grapple.** A Grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the grapple's escape DC, ending the condition on itself on a success. The condition also ends if the grappler has the Incapacitated condition or if the distance between the Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grapple's range.
