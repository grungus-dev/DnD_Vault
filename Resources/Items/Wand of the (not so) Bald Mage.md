This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll a d100 and consult the following table to discover what happen, if you target a space but roll something that targets a creature, nothing happens and the charge is not wasted.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

"Oh and try not to roll 3 100's I've heard how of how it becomes sort of a "curse", although I've heard rolling 3 1's is almost like a 'wish' come true"

Even 2 in a row of either of those is something magical come true
