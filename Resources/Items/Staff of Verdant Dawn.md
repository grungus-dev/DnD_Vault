Wellspring of life, this staff has very strong healing properties if the user is tied to nature and when activated the staff sinks it roots into the ground and delivers a faint glow.  

The staff  sprouts grass and flowers within 30 feet. No one can move this staff unless the user demands it, and anyone with in the light gets +1 to AC for user and every turn will roll a d6 for the amount of health healed and overheal(overheal lasts only the length of battle).  That every turn back to the holder the radius shrinks by 5 ft (user must be within its radius to control it). 

2 charges per long rest.

An enemy within the range can be grappled using one of the uses on the staff. Roots come up from the ground and try to wrap around the enemy. The enemy must succeed in a Dexterity check better that 11.
