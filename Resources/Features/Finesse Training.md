At 1st level, you are trained in unarmored combat styles using monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. Darts also count as monk weapons for you.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your monk weapons.
- Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

Certain ninja clans use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a shortsword with a slightly curved single-edged blade (called a _wakizashi_) or darts that have four pointed blades (called _shurikens_). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.
