Mother killed in home invasion.  Humans had heard of a house of Trollkin somewhere in the woods and assumed they were monsters, they burned the home down in the night.

Father saved Orgren from the house but was blinded by rage. He found a safe cave for Orgren and told him to stay put and went to kill the village of humans. 

The next day Orgren ventured out of the cave and found the village. His father was nowhere to be found, but neither were any living humans. The only sign of life in the village was a still-lit forge with a half finished sword nearby. Orgren felt... compelled to finish the project.  

From there, it's all he knew. He developed a strange fascination with fire. Normally it's a troll's only weakness, but Orgren feels a strange motherly connection when he is in the midst of fire.  The balance between warmth and destruction is what drew Orgren in initially and has never fully left him.
