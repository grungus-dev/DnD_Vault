# Gritit Bomb
As an action spend 2 ki points, you levitate 10ft into the air.  Hold your hands above your head and concentrate the energy from the planet and the creatures around you. You create a large orb of energy above your head.  Hurl the energy to a point you choose within 150 feet where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light.

Each creature in a 20-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The energy spreads around corners.

**_Energy Increase_** You can increase the sphere’s damage by spending ki points or additional actions. For every ki point you spend or future action you use to hold this bomb, the bomb's damage increases by 2d6 and the radius by 5 ft.
