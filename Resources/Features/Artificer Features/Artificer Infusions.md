_**Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item. The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.**_

**_Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level._**

**_Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.**

### Arcane Propulsion Armor

**_Prerequisite: 14th-level artificer_**  
**_Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)_**

The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:

- The wearer's walking speed increases by 5 feet.

- The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.

- The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will.

- If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs - hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.
