At 3rd level your strike quickly and with deadly precision. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll The attack must use unarmed strike or a monk weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Ninja table.
