M.A.S.H is a military grade, surveillance and assault unit created by the Socrates military to stamp out any rebels or unlawful rats trying to overthrow the government, one day he was sent on a mission to destroy a rebel hideout but never returned and was deemed dead by the military, he was just a dispensable puppet to them, no one even looked,many many years go by until one day a lone tinker by the name of Timothy shroud stumbles across him half buried in the ground and with a fading light in his eyes and when he excavates him, he discovers his body is badly, damaged and rusting almost beyond repair and dirt filled every crevice. He takes him back to his workshop and cleans him up and works away at day and night,blood and sweat and eventually gets him online,the then found that MASH was a special unit in that he had access to the usage of magic through a stone hidden in his chest, but because he was so broken and corroded the gem was cracked, giving him only minor control of his magic, once he woke mash up he found that he had no recollection of his past life,that was the one thing Timothy could not fix. The tinker taught him day by day how to live as a human, he wanted this robot to enjoy his new life, he learned math, and English and philosophy and history, but although he’s made new, he still has a fractured brain of an assault model, his head still sparks from the damage, and although his personality is usually joyful or clueless that can always change, MASH choose to keep the name of the ones who left him to die in remembrance of how far he has gone and of the person he became, after many years the tinker who he thought of as a father to him sadly passed of old age and left him with his wisdom and a sense of self, MASH then set out to find others like his father had done for him though there is no say if he will stray from this path, temptation is a humans weakness and he still has the circretry of a military machine.
