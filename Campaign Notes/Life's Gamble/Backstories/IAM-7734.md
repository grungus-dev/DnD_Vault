Iam hails from the once-prosperous city of Valeria, nestled in a verdant valley at the edge of the Kingdom of Eldrin. Raised in a family of devout knights sworn to protect their homeland, I was immersed from a young age in the teachings of honor, duty, and the divine path of a Paladin. Trained by my father, a respected captain of the city's guard, I showed great promise as a warrior. I was soon inducted into the Order of the Radiant Shield, a revered order dedicated to upholding justice and combating evil in all its forms. My life seemed set on a path of service until tragedy struck—an invasion led by the Cult of the Eternal Night devastated Valeria, leaving it in ruins and its people scattered. Desperate to defend my home and seek vengeance for the loss of my loved ones, I turned to any power that could help them, leading to an encounter with a mysterious entity known as the Hexblade, a sentient weapon bound to the Shadowfell. Seeing no other way to gain the strength to confront such a formidable foe, I made a pact with the Hexblade, accepting its dark power. Cast out by some members of their order for embracing what I saw as forbidden magic, I took to adventuring, driven by a thirst for justice, redemption, and the hope that I might one day reclaim my homeland and end the evil that destroyed it.
