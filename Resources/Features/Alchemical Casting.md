At 6th level, you learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic into your spell to amplify it. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend. 

An additional **1st-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase the damage against every target by 2d10 force damage. If the spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell. 

An additional **2nd-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s range. If the spell’s range is at least 30 feet, it becomes 1 mile. 

An additional **3rd-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s potency. Increase the spell’s save DC by 2.
