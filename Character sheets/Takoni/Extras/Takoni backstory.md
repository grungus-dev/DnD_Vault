Takoni's story begins with his grandfather, Captain Brinebeard, though this was before he had claimed that legendary name.

Brinebeard was a Fish-man born as a multipod, with characteristics similar to that of an octopus. He was born on Fish-man Island in a rundown fishing village known as Baytown. Most of the Fish-men with more predatory features (teeth, spines, etc.) would go group up to go out to sea, perusing their own careers. The "squishy" Fish-men are told to stay on their comfortable island.

Brinebeard decided to be the one to break this cycle, gathering a crew of the "squishies" and setting out to sea. His only goal was to plunder something truly legendary, to prove to all of the "less dangerous" Fish-men that their genetics do not determine their future. When he initially departed he left a girl of the name Oba, he said that he'll be, "Back someday, but whether its in one piece or many, I don't know." 

After many years his status and his crew grew substantially, with him becoming a very respected pirate. At some point he came back to Fish-man Island and he had a kid with Oba. They named the child Okaa. Brinebeard would come back to Baytown periodically, always claiming that his next adventure would be his last. He knew that there was some greater treasure out there waiting for him. One of these visits he met a kid around the same age as his daughter, this kid's only goal was to become a pirate.  Seeing much of himself in the child, Brinebeard caved and allowed the kid to join his crew, the Squishy Pirates.

This child's name was Otou, and he grew in status and in power within Brinebeard's crew, and eventually became his right-hand man. 

Finally, Captain Brinebeard achieved his biggest goal. After a long and drawn out battle Brinebeard found his greatest treasure: a Devil Fruit.  Not just any Devil Fruit, a legendary one. Brinebeard never understood why, but this devil fruit in particular was widely sought after by many powerful pirate crews. Finally feeling fulfilled, Captain Brinebeard declared that this was his final mission, and that he would retire to Baytown for good.

However, this story is not a fairy tale. On their way back to Fish-man island the crew was assailed by a high ranking pirate crew. The crew was powerful enough to fend the attack off, but not before Captain Brinebeard was inflicted with a fatal wound.

Brinebeard had two dying wishes as he lay dying on the deck: one was that he wanted his treasure to be delivered to his wife back on Fish-man Island, the other was that Otou took over his place as captain of the Squishy Pirates. 

___

Much time had passes since the Squishy Pirates had last sailed, as everyone was recovering from the loss of their captain. During this time Otou and Okaa had grown quite close, and this led them to becoming lovers. By the time that Otou had set off to return to sea, he did not know that he left Okaa with child. A pair of twins that would be named Takoichi and Takoni have been concieved.

Unfortunately, these children would never know their father.  After a few years at sea, word that the Squishy Pirates were back had spread along the Grand Line. This news spread to the same group that attacked the crew all those years ago, and this news made them very interested. The group had grown much in strength, and Brinebeard's old crew were getting used to life at the sea again. The Squishy Pirates were attacked and annihilated at sea, as the pirate group still yearned for Brinebeard's treasure.

News of the Squishy Pirate's destruction spread to Fish-man island, and Okaa was devastated.  In an effort to protect her kids, forbid each of them from ever becoming pirates.

___

Many years came and went, and the twins' 13th birthday had recently passed. One day Oba was out in the market and heard news that there were was a pirate crew seen in the distance. Pirate crews were not uncommon in Baytown, but a crew of this size coming to dock had not been seen since Brinebeard was in his prime.

Okaa was suspicious of these pirates and she told the children to hide with grandpa's treasure if they come to the house. There was a room with a shrine dedicated to Captain Brinebeard, and there was a great portrait that was created in his honor. Using some funds that the Squishy pirates donated to the family there was a secret vault built behind that portrait. The vault was quite large, but the only thing that lay within it was Captain Brinebeard's prized Devil Fruit. Brinebeard wanted Oba to have the fruit, but she knew how dear the fruit was and thought that it lay better with him.

The group of pirates did come to the house to ask about Brinebeard, since they heard from other villagers that she was his daughter. The twins scurried away to hide within the vault in grandpa's shrine. The pirates forced their way into the house using their numbers and started ransacking the place. Okaa showed them to their other vault that contained all of the remaining gold from Brinebeard's adventures. The mother hoped that this would satisfy the brutes, but it wasn't enough. The pirates grew angry and this led to the slaying of both Oba and Okaa. The plundering increased in the house, with talks to burn it down and search the ashes if they don't find anything. 

This sparked a panic from the twins who had heard everything. The older of the two, Takoichi, came up with a plan to distract the pirates while the younger one, Takoni, ran away. Takoichi told Takoni to eat their grandfather's prized devil fruit, and how Takoni has to be the one to carry on Brinebeard's memory. 

Takoichi burst out from the vault, loudly proclaiming that the treasure they were seeking was already within his stomach. This caught a the pirates in the house by surprise, with the mass number rushing to pile into the room and tripping over each other. During all this chaos, Takoni managed to slip through the sliding door that led outside unnoticed.  

Takoni had no direction of where to go.  He simply ran.  The fruit tasted disgusting, despite how delectable it may have looked. He made it to the shore nearest to his house, and he was reminded of a nearby island that he was never allowed to go to.  He was told it was a "forbidden place", but with nowhere else to go Takoni found a rowboat on the shore and paddled over. This was a good choice as he wasn't aware of the negative consequences of eating a devil fruit yet. 

Takoni arrived at the island, got out of his boat, and he remembered no more of that day.

___

Takoni awoke to sunlight trickling in through an entanglement of trees. He found that he was in a village purely held within the high branches of a large forest. After much balancing and traversing bark pathways, he found an old man known as Sensei Buu. Sensei Buu is a fish-man who Takoni found is the leader of a hidden group of assassins that lived in this village. His scouts had found him on the shore of the island and took him in for rest. 

Takoni immediately begged for the Sensei's help in saving his brother from the pirates. But Sensei Buu informed the young octopus that he had been asleep for two days after the attack on his home, and that the pirates had already departed from Fish-man Island.  Buu's scouts had found Takoni's home in a wreck, and also found the bodies of Oba and Okaa. But no sign of Takoichi was found.  The Sensei suspected that the pirates had kidnapped his older brother.

Takoni asked where the pirates went as he had to save his brother, but the old man stopped him, stating that going after that pirate group now would be suicide. But Sensei Buu took pity on the poor boy and offered to take Takoni into his village, with the caveat that he had to train in the art of ninjatsu and become a student of his. Takoni's will was already hardened and he was determined to rescue his brother.

___

After seven years of grueling training, discipline, and growth, Sensei Buu decided that Takoni had been taught all that he could teach him. Takoni had grown to harness not only his body's strength, but also the strength of his grandfather's Devil Fruit that lives within him.

Sensei Buu had used his scout and resources to find out more information about why this Devil Fruit was so special to this group of pirates. It seems that there was a legend revolving the Jellyfish Zoan fruit. The legend states that the user of the fruit will be able to harness the ability of the Immortal Jellyfish, essentially not being able to die of old age. Though through the years of this legend existing, pirates started to believe this this fruit gave the user full immortality.

Takoni had been growing stronger this whole time, but so have the pirate group. Even in Takoni's current state his master thought that he just Takoni wouldn't be enough to beat them.  However, Sensei Buu's scouts had found out about the existence of a legendary sword that is stated to give its user incredible power if he has the discipline to wield it.

After preparing in every way he could think of, Takoni set off to the seas.  To find the legendary blade which will save his brother and get revenge on his most hated foe.
