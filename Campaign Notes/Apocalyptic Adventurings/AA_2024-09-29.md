# Going to Rolph's home.

Travelled with Rolph from the farmhouse

About a week going in a straight line, then Rolph finds a path in the woods and looks straight up
- Looks at big cloud/castle in the sky thing 

Travel along the path for a bit, then get attacked
- attackers are after Erik and Rolph
- Hired by guy Evil Knight guy that slaved Rolph
- Even though the boy is dead they still wanna kill

Get a cool hairpin 
- Related to the banshee
- Feel pain when the scarf is pierced with needle

Come to a door in a cave
- giant's writing upon the door
- Rolph cannot speak
	- but Erik speaks giant and incanted the door
- Door opens and we go through

Give Rolph my quill for whenever he needs to talk
- tap twice on the ground to communicate


# Thrims Hollow
Go to giant village through the door
- clay houses
- Find village elder
- Persuaded him to help Rolph

## Outside the Elder's tent
- Waited very patiently
- I almost got grabbed by baby

Rolph is not going to make it 
- Wants to be sacrificed to his the giant's god, Ylmir

They knew Rolph before he departed

Talked to elder about Davestowne
- He knew Bellydrum
	- Later Oskar knew him as Elvis
		- Elvis had an invention.. One that had great healing ability
			- Bragged about it a lot according to Elder
			- Oskar never heard about it 
		- Elvis was part of an adventuring group
			- Elvis, the Elder, the Bastard, and i think 2 others
